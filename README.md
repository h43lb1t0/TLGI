# Number Base Change Calculator
### Why?
This is foremost a tool I created to help myself learn how to convert numbers between different bases (by hand). In the future I may add some other tools here around the module "Technische und logische Grundlagen der Informatik" (TLGI) which translates to "Technical and logical Fundamentals of Computer Science".

It is designed to not only perform the conversion but also to log the steps (in a format like a human would do on paper) taken during the conversion process to learn and understand how the conversion is done.

# Features
- Convert numbers between Bases 2 - 10 and Base 16
- Logs each step of the conversion process
- Works for both integer and fractional parts of numbers

# Usage
To use the base converter, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python NumberBaseChangeCalculator.py
```
